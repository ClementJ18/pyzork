==================

Hidden Big Golbin
-------------------
You (the player) arrive in a market place, to the north there is a tavern, to the east a shop, to the west a back alley and to the south a dock. The dock connects to and island on which there is a temple, the temple door is locked so you can't enter.

If you go to the tavern you can talk to an old man, the old man will give you a quest to kill the goblin in the back alley. Once you've killed the goblin the door to the temple opens, letting you enter and fight the Big Goblin, if you kill the big goblin you win.
